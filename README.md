# Scraping the Web
This is Kevin Zhang's CS 242 Assignment 2. It's interesting I swear :)

### Install
You can download source code from GitLab and put into a foler.

### Run
Open Jupyter Nootbook or PyCharm or whatever Python IDE you like and run it from there.

```sh
scraper.py
```
This is the main function which does web scrapping from Wikipedia. It will start scraping from "List of actors with Academy Award nominations
" and save all the actors/actresses as well as film information into graph data structure and a local JSON file.

```sh
query.py
```
This is the function where you could perform queries on data you have just scraped from Wikipedia. You could change the parameters on the bottom and you will get some interesting discoveries!
